# Tracker Patches (MERN Edition)

Tracker Patches is a prototype MERN-stack web/app where a user can register, login, and share music/instrument patches for Deflemask and Furnace music trackers. 

This project is NOT affiliated with tildearrow, Delek, Furnace, or DefleMask in any way, nor it is a replacement for any other collections of presets / patches for these two amazing digital audio workstations.

Planned Future Features:
- better mobile design 
- regex validation for patch submission
- profile updates and patch sharing
- browse and search by user and tags
